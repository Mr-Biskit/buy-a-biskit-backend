# Buy A Biskit

This project was made for the Alchemy #rtw3 Week 2 

You can see the frontend of this repo at: https://github.com/Mr-Biskit/buy-a-biskit-frontend

This project demonstrates a basic funding contract. It comes with a contract, a test for that contract, and a script for verifying the contract on Goerli network.

Try running the tests I wrote:

```bash
hh test
```

## Important

The following is additions and changes I made from the original tutorial:

- Using the the hardhat-deploy plugin : https://github.com/wighawag/hardhat-deploy/tree/master

- Verifying the contract using hardhat verify

- Writting a small amount of functionality tests
